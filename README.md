## Description

This package is designed to analyze DNA sequence considered as promoter regions of genes. It use the published databases from PLACE -- Plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements¹ and AtcisDB - Arabidopsis cis-regulatory element database². 

##Introduction
The Package includes a Rscript which is the program that must be launched from terminal with the appropiate arguments.
